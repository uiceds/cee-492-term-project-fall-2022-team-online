## Proposal {.page_break_before}

The team plans to predict the 28<sup>th</sup> day compressive strength of the concrete given a proportion of water, cement, aggregates, and percentage of additives. The dataset has 8 input parameters and 1 output parameter. The model predicts the interactions between the concrete mixture components and the compressive strength. 

High-standard quality control of concrete can be a challenge to producers.
The error rate of concrete compressive strength, the most important quality indicator in the concrete industry, can be exaggerated. Developing accurate and reliable compressive strength prediction models could save costs and time. Therefore, much research has been conducted to predict concrete compressive strength.

Based on the dataset, these models aim to predict concrete's 28<sup>th</sup> day compressive strength. Traditionally, to compare the actual compressive strength of concrete (q'<sup>c</sup>) against the desired strength (q'<sup>cd</sup>), 28 days need to pass. Then a cube sample can is crushed to check the compressive strength. That is usually not a problem if the 28<sup>th</sup> day Ca matches the Cd. However, if there is a mismatch in Ca and Cd, there could be massive hacking of concrete or additional structures put in place to enhance the strength further.

These models instantaneously predict the 28<sup>th</sup> day compressive strength when a batch of concrete mix is made to minimize such errors. Eventually, with enough confidence, it aims to change the default measurement of 28<sup>th</sup> day compressive strength from cube crushing to using this predictive model. 

A dataset with 1030 different observations will be used to train and validate four different models, and the advantages and disadvantages of each option will be discussed. Finally, the accuracy and precision of these models will be assessed using different methods (such as comparing rmse and r<sup>2</sup> values), and recommendations to improve the models' performance will be suggested.
