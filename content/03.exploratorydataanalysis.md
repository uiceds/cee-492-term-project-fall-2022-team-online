## Exploratory Data Analysis {.page_break_before}

A comprehensive exploratory analysis will be performed in this section to understand further our dataset (the concrete mixture components), each parameter's role in the compressive strength of concrete, and the relationships between the different parameters. 

### Summary Statistics

This section illustrates the general statistics of the dataset to show simple trends between the different parameters.

Table @tbl:summarytable shows the mean, standard deviation, minimum & maximum, first quartile, median, and third quartile. Figure @fig:summaryfig shows a visual form of Table @tbl:summarytable.

The main components, cement, water, and aggregates, are present in all concrete mixes. The aggregates make a major portion of the concrete mix. The portion of water in the observations does not vary as much as the other main components.

Table: Secondary Component Observation Count
{#tbl:seccompobstable}

Blast furnace slag, fly ash, and superplasticizer are not present in all observations. Table @tbl:seccompobstable shows that there are 209 observations without secondary components. The superplasticizer is the most prevalent of the secondary components, with 651 total observations. However, superplasticizer has the least average mass in the concrete mix. There are no observations with both blast furnace slag and fly ash. 

The median age of concrete strength measurement is at 28 days. Typical concrete testing in the industry is made on the 28<sup>th</sup> day. Some observations were measured after a year from casting. 

The mean age of concrete strength for the dataset is 35.8 MPa. The minimum and maximum concrete strength observed are 2.3 MPa and 82.6 MPa, respectively.

### Correlation
In this section, the general correlations between various variables have been examined. The purpose is to understand how variables affect each other and how each variable affects the compressive strength of concrete.

|                            | Cement (kg/m3) | Blast Furnace Slag (kg/m3) | Fly Ash (kg/m3) | Compressive strength (MPa) |
|----------------------------|----------------|----------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------|
|             Cement (kg/m3) |           1.00 |                      -0.28 |           -0.40 |                       0.50 |
| Blast Furnace Slag (kg/m3) |          -0.28 |                       1.00 |           -0.32 |                       0.13 |
|            Fly Ash (kg/m3) |          -0.40 |                      -0.32 |            1.00 |                      -0.11 |
| Compressive strength (MPa) |           0.50 |                       0.13 |           -0.11 |                       1.00 |
Table: Correlation table of cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, compressive strength
{#tbl:corr13}

Figure @fig:Plot_1to3 and Table @tbl:corr13 show that apart from the positive correlation of compressive strength to cement, most other correlations have a neutral to negative correlation.  

Comparing compressive strength against cement content, we observe a moderate positive correlation of 0.50. It shows that as cement content increases, the compressive strength of the concrete also increases. 

For compressive strength against blast furnace slag and fly ash, which are commonly used as fillers for cement, it can be seen that they have a very weak correlation of 0.13 and -0.11. As such, we conclude that blast furnace slag and fly ash do not affect compressive strength when used as fillers for cement. 

For the correlation plots comparing fly ash against cement, fly ash against blast furnace slag, and blast furnace slag against cement, it can be seen that they have a weak correlation of -0.40, -0.32, and -0.28. The negative correlations correlate with existing knowledge that blast furnace slag and fly ash are cement substitutes. When the content of blast furnace slag or fly ash goes up, the cement content goes down.  

From the histogram plots, it can be seen that Blast Furnace Slag and Fly Ash have a high count of zero, showing that not all concrete mix designs require them. As such, it might be essential to consider the effects of the large amounts of zeros during preliminary modelling.

|                            | Water (kg/m3) | Superplasticizer (kg/m3) | Compressive strength (MPa) |
|----------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
|              Water (kg/m3) |          1.00 |                    -0.66 |                      -0.29 |
|   Superplasticizer (kg/m3) |         -0.66 |                     1.00 |                       0.37 |
| Compressive strength (MPa) |         -0.29 |                     0.37 |                       1.00 |

Table: Correlation coefficients of water , superplasticizer and compressive strength
{#tbl:corr4to5}

From Table @tbl:corr4to5, we see a weak positive correlation of 0.36 between the amount of superplasticizer in the mix and compressive strength. Table @tbl:corr4to5 also shows a weak negative correlation of -0.29 between Water content and compressive strength. 
As expected, the more water we have in the mix, the weaker the concrete and the more superplasticizer we have, the stronger the concrete. We can also observe that Water content and superplasticizer amount have a strong negative correlation of -0.65. Overall the more superplasticizer we have, the less water there is in these concrete mixes.

Table: Correlation coefficients of water , superplasticizer and compressive strength
{#tbl:corr6to7}

In Table @tbl:corr6to7, we can see the correlations between fine aggregates, coarse aggregates and compressive strength. We have a weak negative correlation of   -0.16 between Fine aggregates and compressive strength and a weak negative correlation coefficient of -0.16 between coarse aggregates and compressive strength. We might gain more insight by taking these two elements together and comparing them to the compressive strength.  

These correlations are in line with what is expected for a concrete mix. However, more in-depth correlations using combinations of different components are investigated to understand our dataset further. 

### Specific Correlation

In this section, the specific interactions between variables will be further discussed.

![
Correlation plot of water/cement ratio against the concrete compressive strength
](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiceds/cee-492-term-project-fall-2022-team-online/main/reference/Dafar/plot_5.png "Plot_5"){#fig:wTOcfig1 width="500px"}

Figure @fig:wTOcfig1 shows the relationship between the water-to-cement ratio (w/c) and concrete compressive strength. This ratio is considered the most significant influence on the final compressive strength of the concrete mixture. As we can see from Figure @fig:wTOcfig1, the strength of concrete increases as the w/c decreases. The reason for that is as the amount of water increases in the mixture (for a specific amount of cement), the distance between the cement particles increases, which leads to a more diluted and weaker paste. In practice, the w/c ranges from about 0.3 to over 0.8, which is the range with the largest number of data, as seen in the histogram in Figure @fig:wTOcfig1. It is noticeable that there is a significant amount of scatter in this relationship which can be attributed to two main reasons. First, this figure includes all the available concrete compressive strength data measured at different ages. Second, other factors play a role in the final concrete compressive strength, like the amount of fine and coarse aggregates, and these factors are not filtered within the data used to plot this figure.

To see how much better the relationship can be, the factor of the concrete age was eliminated. In Figure @fig:wTOcfig2, we plot the same relationship as in Figure @fig:wTOcfig1 but use the concrete compressive strength data at 28 days. It is clear that the scatter has been reduced, and the effect of the w/c became more apparent.  

The same trend can also be observed in work done by the US Bureau of Reclamation (1975), as shown in Figure @fig:wTOcfig3 below.

Figure @fig:wTOcfig4 shows averaged compressive strength from observations with the same primary components and more than five instances of measurement in time. 

![

In addition to the w/c, the compressive strength against age can also be referenced to established standards. Figure @fig:wTOcfig5 shows that concrete compressive strength increases significantly in the first four weeks from casting and increases gradually after that. The same trend illustrated in Figure @fig:wTOcfig4 can be seen in Figure @fig:wTOcfig5. 

All these observations gathered from the general trends and the in-depth relationships will be used to improve our different models by utilizing techniques like feature selection, which we will discuss in the following sections.
